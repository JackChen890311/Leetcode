### Notes:
- Nice question, just use two pointer and swap any 1 & 0 that's not in the right place,
- Mathmatically it will end up in the correct answer
- Alternatively (even better!): Iterate right to left and count the number of `0` that have already occurred, whenever you iterate on `1` add that counter to the answer.
