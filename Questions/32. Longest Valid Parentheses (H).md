- 題目看起來很簡單，但實際上還真的蠻難的
> So in this case I use stack and an array, and then change this problem as finding longest continuous 1 in a 01 array. Let me tell how to do it.
First, stack push position of each '(', then when we meet ')' I pop stack to find its match'('， place both ')' and '(' as 1 in array
For example, (()()，array should look like[0,1,1,1,1]
Then it is super easy, to find out longest substring that all items are 1 !!!
