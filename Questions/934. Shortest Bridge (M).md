Intuition
Use DFS for traversal of 1st island.(same can be done using BFS)
Use BFS for finding smallest path to the 2nd island.
Approach
Traverse the 1st island found using dfs.
While doing dfs add all the water boundaries(i,j)grid[i][j]=0 of 1st island in the queue.
Using multi-source BFS, find the smallest path to the 2nd island.
