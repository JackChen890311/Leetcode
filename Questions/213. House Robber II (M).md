- 其實有大概的想法，可惜沒想出來，基本上就是拆成兩個 case：nums[0:N-1] & nums[1:]，兩種各跑一次 [[198. House Robber (M)]] 取 max 就會是答案了
- Since House[1] and House[n] are adjacent, they cannot be robbed together. Therefore, the problem becomes to rob either House[1]-House[n-1] or House[2]-House[n], depending on which choice offers more money. Now the problem has degenerated to the [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/), which is already been solved.
