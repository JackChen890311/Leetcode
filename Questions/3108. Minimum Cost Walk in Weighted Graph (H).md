### Notes:
- Finally solve a hard one during contest!
- Connected Component + Disjoint Set + Bitwise will do the work! 
- Simply find all the connected components using disjoint set, then the cost of any two nodes in the same component will have the cost of "all weights combined together using bitwise AND", and -1 if they're not in the same component.
