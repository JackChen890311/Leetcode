### Notes:
- Also refer to [[42. Trapping Rain Water (H)]]
- Can use the same approach as [[42. Trapping Rain Water (H)]]: find left and right boundary then calculate each maximum area
- Or use this magical approach: Calculate area only when meeting right boundary, also keep track of left boundary (I can definitely not think of this solution on my own)
```python=
  def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
	heights.append(0)
	stack = [-1]
	ans = 0
	for i in range(len(heights)):
		while heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]:
			h = heights[stack.pop()]
			w = i - stack[-1] - 1
			ans = max(ans, h * w)
			print(h, w, stack)
		stack.append(i)
	heights.pop()
	return ans
```
