- Use binary representaion, each digit represent a number (2^n -> n). For each value `num`, find all valid value (all number less than `num`, also need to appear in previous result) in binary representation `validX = x & ((1 << num) - 1)` , then shift the valid value `num` times `x |= validX << num`. Finally, the length of x -1 will be the result. Clever!
